TALK,Boy,Hey! You're stuck here too! It's been ages since they've sent someone down here.
TALK,Boy,How do we get out? You're not supposed to. Didn't they tell you it's impossible?
TALK,Boy,They said you need to collect items to escape? That's the first I've ever heard of this.
TALK,Boy,Anything I've noticed? All I've noticed is that there are letters scattered about this dungeon.
